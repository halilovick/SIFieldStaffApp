Acceptance Criteria:

storeToken Function:

    The function must successfully store a token in AsyncStorage.
    In case of an error during storage, an appropriate error message should be logged.

getToken Function:

    The function must retrieve and return the correct token from AsyncStorage if it exists.
    If no token exists, the function should return null.
    In case of an error during retrieval, an appropriate error message should be logged, and the function should return null.

makeAuthenticatedRequest Function:

    The function must not proceed with a request if no token is stored.
    If a token exists, the function should make an HTTP request with the token included in the authorization header.
    The function should store a new token if the response includes one.
    In case of an HTTP error, an appropriate error message should be logged, and the function should return null.



Test Scenarios

1. Storing a Token:

    Store a token successfully.
    Attempt to store a token when an error occurs.

2. Retrieving a Token:

    Retrieve a token successfully.
    Attempt to retrieve a token when none exists.
    Attempt to retrieve a token when an error occurs.

3. Making an Authenticated Request:

    Make a request with a valid token and receive data successfully.
    Attempt to make a request with no token stored.
    Receive and store a new token from the response of an authenticated request.
    Attempt to make a request that results in an HTTP error.



Test Cases

storeToken Function:

    Test Case 1:
        Given a valid token,
        When storeToken is called,
        Then the token should be stored in AsyncStorage without errors.

getToken Function:

    Test Case 2:
        Given a token is stored,
        When getToken is called,
        Then the function should return the stored token.


    Test Case 3:

        Given no token is stored,
        When getToken is called,
        Then the function should return null.

makeAuthenticatedRequest Function:

    Test Case 4:

        Given a valid token is stored,
        When makeAuthenticatedRequest is called with valid request parameters,
        Then the function should make the HTTP request and return the response data.

    Test Case 5:

        Given no token is stored,
        When makeAuthenticatedRequest is called,
        Then the function should not make the HTTP request and return null.
